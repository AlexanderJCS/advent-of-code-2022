# Advent of Code 2022
These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2022. They may not be the best solutions, but they work. I'll predominantly be using Java for this because I am learning the language for AP Computer Science this year, but you may find me using C++ and Python as well.

# Contributing

Because this repository is made to log my progress in Advent of Code 2022, pull requests to improve code or to add solutions are not welcome.
